## My process

### Built with

- Astro
- Astro [Major Tom](https://github.com/Smart-Ace-Designs/Astro-Major-Tom) Template
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- Bun

### What I learned

- How to center items both vertically and horizontally.
- How to add custom colors to Tailwind CSS by adding it to the `extend` object in the "tailwind.config.mjs" file.
- How to add a custom font family to Tailwind CSS by creating custom style sheet file to import the font and then by adding it to the `extend` object in the "tailwind.config.mjs" file.
- How to use Bun

### Continued development

During this build I did not use the provided Figma document as I currently do not have a Figma account. Learning and using Figma in the future might help better match the spacing and dimensions of the solution to the design specification.

### Useful resources

- [Net Ninja (Tailwind CSS Tutorial)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UVQlB1eo5A&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gpXORlEHjc5bgnIi5HEGhw&index=5) - This helped me configure Tailwind CSS with custom colors and fonts.
